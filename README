#FMS2OBJ

FMS2OBJ takes the various models and other resources from Harvest Moon: Animal Parade and extracts them into readable formats. These formats include obj and mtl files for 3D data (FMES, FMAT), and PNG files (from textures).

Right now, any unhandled formats are extracted from pBIN archives as binary files.

See hmap_fms.txt for format details.

This project requires Lua 5.3, Lua File System, and LuaGD (for PNG exporting).
